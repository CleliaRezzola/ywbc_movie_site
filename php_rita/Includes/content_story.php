					<h2>The Tell-Tale Heart</h2><br>
						"The Tell-Tale Heart" is a first-person narrative of an unnamed narrator who insists he is sane but suffering from a disease (nervousness) which causes "over-acuteness of the senses". The old man with whom he lives has a clouded, pale, blue "vulture-like" eye which so distresses the narrator that he plots to murder the old man, though the narrator states that he loves the old man, and hates only the eye. The narrator insists that his careful precision in committing the murder shows that he cannot possibly be insane. For seven nights, the narrator opens the door of the old man's room, in order to shine a sliver of light onto the "evil eye". However, the old man's vulture-eye is always closed, making it impossible to "do the work".
						On the eighth night, the old man awakens after the narrator's hand slips and makes a noise, interrupting the narrator's nightly ritual. But the narrator does not draw back and, after some time, decides to open his lantern. A single thin ray of light shines out and lands precisely on the "evil eye", revealing that it is wide open. Hearing the old man's heart beating loudly and dangerously fast from terror, the narrator decides to strike, jumping out with a loud yell and smothering the old man with his own bed. The narrator then dismembers the body and conceals the pieces under the floorboards, making certain to hide all signs of the crime. Even so, the old man's scream during the night causes a neighbor to report to the police. The narrator invites the three arriving officers in to look around. He claims that the screams heard were his own in a nightmare and that the man is absent in the country. Confident that they will not find any evidence of the murder, the narrator brings chairs for them and they sit in the old man's room, on the very spot where the body is concealed, yet they suspect nothing, as the narrator has a pleasant and easy manner about him.
						The narrator, however, begins to feel uncomfortable and notices a ringing in his ears. As the ringing grows louder, the narrator comes to the conclusion that it is the heartbeat of the old man coming from under the floorboards. The sound increases steadily, though the officers seem to pay no attention to it. Terrified by the violent beating of the heart, and convinced that the officers are aware of not only the heartbeat, but his guilt as well, the narrator breaks down and confesses. He tells them to tear up the floorboards to reveal the body.

					<h2>The Cask</h2><br>
						The story's narrator, Montresor, tells the story of the day that he took his revenge on Fortunato, a fellow nobleman, to an unspecified person who knows him very well. Angry over some unspecified insult, he plots to murder his friend during Carnival when the man is drunk, dizzy, and wearing a jester's motley.
						He baits Fortunato by telling him he has obtained what he believes to be a pipe (about 130 gallons, 492 litres) of a rare vintage of Amontillado. He claims he wants his friend's expert opinion on the subject. Fortunato goes with Montresor to the wine cellars of the latter's palazzo, where they wander in the catacombs. Montresor offers wine (first Medoc, then De Grave) to Fortunato. Montresor warns Fortunato, who has a bad cough, of the damp, and suggests they go back; Fortunato insists on continuing, claiming that "[he] shall not die of a cough." During their walk, Montresor mentions his family coat of arms: a golden foot in a blue background crushing a snake whose fangs are embedded in the foot's heel, with the motto Nemo me impune lacessit ("No one insults me with impunity").
						At one point, Fortunato makes an elaborate, grotesque gesture with an upraised wine bottle. When Montresor appears not to recognize the gesture, Fortunato asks, "You are not of the masons?" Montresor says he is, and when Fortunato, disbelieving, requests a sign, Montresor displays a trowel he had been hiding. When they come to a niche, Montresor tells his victim that the Amontillado is within. Fortunato enters and, drunk and unsuspecting, does not resist as Montresor quickly chains him to the wall. Montresor then declares that, since Fortunato won't go back, he must "positively leave".
						Montresor walls up the niche, entombing his friend alive. At first, Fortunato, who sobers up faster than Montresor anticipated he would, shakes the chains, trying to escape. Fortunato then screams for help, but Montresor mocks his cries, knowing nobody can hear them. Fortunato laughs weakly and tries to pretend that he is the subject of a joke and that people will be waiting for him (including the Lady Fortunato). As the murderer finishes the topmost row of stones, Fortunato wails, "For the love of God, Montresor!" Montresor replies, "Yes, for the love of God!" He listens for a reply but hears only the jester's bells ringing. Before placing the last stone, he drops a burning torch through the gap. He claims that he feels sick at heart, but dismisses this reaction as an effect of the dampness of the catacombs.
						In the last few sentences, Montresor reveals that in the 50 years since that night, he has never been caught, and Fortunato's body still hangs from its chains in the niche where he left it. The murderer concludes: In pace requiescat! ("May he rest in peace!")

					<h2>The Dreams</h2><br>
						Oh! that my young life were a lasting dream!<br>
						My spirit not awakening, till the beam<br>
						Of an Eternity should bring the morrow. <br>
						Yes! tho' that long dream were of hopeless sorrow, <br>
						'Twere better than the cold reality <br>
						Of waking life, to him whose heart must be, <br>
						And hath been still, upon the lovely earth, <br>
						A chaos of deep passion, from his birth. <br>
						But should it be- that dream eternally <br>
						Continuing- as dreams have been to me <br>
						In my young boyhood- should it thus be given, <br>
						'Twere folly still to hope for higher Heaven. <br>
						For I have revell'd, when the sun was bright <br>
						I' the summer sky, in dreams of living light <br>
						And loveliness,- have left my very heart <br>
						In climes of my imagining, apart <br>
						From mine own home, with beings that have been <br>
						Of mine own thought- what more could I have seen? <br>
						'Twas once- and only once- and the wild hour <br>
						From my remembrance shall not pass- some power <br>
						Or spell had bound me- 'twas the chilly wind <br>
						Came o'er me in the night, and left behind <br>
						Its image on my spirit- or the moon <br>
						Shone on my slumbers in her lofty noon <br>
						Too coldly- or the stars- howe'er it was <br>
						That dream was as that night-wind- let it pass. <br>
						I have been happy, tho' in a dream. <br>
						I have been happy- and I love the theme: <br>
						Dreams! in their vivid coloring of life, <br>
						As in that fleeting, shadowy, misty strife <br>
						Of semblance with reality, which brings <br>
						To the delirious eye, more lovely things <br>
						Of Paradise and Love- and all our own! <br>
						Than young Hope in his sunniest hour hath known.<br>
